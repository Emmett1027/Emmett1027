Hi, I'm @Emmett1027.
I'm a bit new to github, so 
I thought that I should make a readme.md.

  If you are reading this... why?
  Is like... always being on someone's
  github respositories a thing?

  𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈'𝐦 𝐃𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠:
    Currently, I am making a website
    for my Minecraft Server.
    It's not released yet, so don't
    expect to be joining it.
    The IP is "murdermobs.minehut.gg"
    It's not up currently.
